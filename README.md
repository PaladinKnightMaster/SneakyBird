# ERC721 NTF Collection for Sneaky Bird

This project uses Hardhat, NextJS, chai, chakra. Also, the VRF Coordinator contract to get a Random number to make a random NFT creation while minting. 

In this project, we'll only mint 925 ERC721 NFTs in total supply.

SneakyBird makes jewelery out of Silver, thus the first collection being a total of 925 NFTs as a reference for Silver's pureness of .925, so from the 925 in total supply we'll give away 6 random pieces but made out of Gold.

Total Supply = 925
Gold Pieces = 6
Silver Pieces = 919
